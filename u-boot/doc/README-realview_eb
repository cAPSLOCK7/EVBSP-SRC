Overview :
--------
The RealView Emulation Baseboard can be fitted with one or two
Core Tiles (CTs). One of the CTs fitted will emulate a particular
ARM core.

As at 2006/09/07, these include:-
	ARM7TDMI
	ARM926EJ-S
	ARM1136JF-S
	ARM11 MPCore 


Boot Methods :
------------
RealView boards may be configured to boot in various ways as described in the User Guide.
As at 2006/09/07, U-Boot assumes that the board will have been reset to have 
RAM mapped at 0x00000000 i.e. that the ARM Boot Monitor will have been run.
For configurations where this is not the case the existing U-Boot code must be modified
to reset the board state correctly.
See the RealView EB User Guide and the ARM PrimeCell System Controller (SP810) TRM
sipplied with the product.

Configuring U-Boot :
------------------
The makefile contains one target for the REalView EB, realview_eb_config.
The U-Boot built to this configuration can be used with any CT.

Board Revision Info
------------------
U-Boot extracts the following values into the Revision field
of /proc/cpuinfo:-
	SYS_ID  @ 0x10000000
See the board User Guide for details of the fields values.
