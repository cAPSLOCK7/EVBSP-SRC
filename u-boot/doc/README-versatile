Overview :
--------
There are two Versatile variants:-
	The Versatile Application Baseboard for ARM926EJ-S (Versatile AB926-EJS)
	The Versatile Platform    Baseboard for ARM926EJ-S (Versatile PB926-EJS)
Both are fitted with an ARM926-EJS Development Chip.

Boot Methods :
------------
Versatile boards may be configured to boot in various ways as described in the User Guide.
As at 2006/09/07, U-Boot assumes that the board will have been reset to have 
RAM mapped at 0x00000000 i.e. that the ARM Boot Monitor will have been run.
For configurations where this is not the case the existing U-Boot code must be modified
to reset the board state correctly.
See section "Removing boot remapping and enabling SDRAM at 0x0" in the User Guide.

Configuring U-Boot :
------------------
The makefile contains targets for Versatile platforms of both types.
	versatileab_config
	versatilepb_config
	versatile_config

Note that versatile_config is the original target.
It has been retained for backward compatibility and is identical to
versatilepb_config. 

Board Revision Info
------------------
U-Boot extracts the following values into the Revision field
of /proc/cpuinfo:-
Versatile/AB :	 SYS_ID  @ 0x10000000
Versatile/PB :	 SYS_ID  @ 0x10000000       
See the board User Guide for details of the fields values.
