The following is a list of files and features that are going to be
removed from the U-Boot source tree.  Every entry should contain what
exactly is going away, when it will be gone, why it is being removed,
and who is going to be doing the work.  When the feature is removed
from U-Boot, its corresponding entry should also be removed from this
file.

---------------------------

What:	"autoscr" command
When:	August 2009
Why:	"autosrc" is an ugly and completely non-standard name.  The "autoscr"
	command is deprecated and will be replaced the "source" command as
	used by other shells such as bash.  Both commands will be supported
	for a transition period of 6 months after which "autoscr" will be
	removed.

---------------------------

What:	Individual I2C commands
When:	April 2009
Why:	Per the U-Boot README, individual I2C commands such as "imd", "imm",
	"imw", etc are deprecated.  The single "i2c" command which is
	currently enabled via CONFIG_I2C_CMD_TREE contains the same
	functionality as the individual I2C commands.  The individual
	I2C commands should be removed as well as any references to
	CONFIG_I2C_CMD_TREE.

---------------------------

What:	Legacy NAND code
When:	April 2009
Why:	Legacy NAND code is deprecated.  Similar functionality exists in
	more recent NAND code ported from the Linux kernel.
